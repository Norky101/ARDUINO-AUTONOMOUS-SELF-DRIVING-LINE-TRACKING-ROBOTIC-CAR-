***ARDUINO AUTONOMOUS SELF DRIVING LINE TRACKING ROBOTIC CAR***

***What does it do?***

Employed C++ to establish software that will control the Arduino microprocessor and drive the hand-built vehicle to follow a black line.

• Calibrated multiple infrared obstacle avoidance sensors to correctly identify a light or dark surface for accurate path guidance.

• Leveraged knowledge of electrical engineering and breadboard circuitry to power the vehicle to transfer potential to kinetic energy.

***Parts to build it***

Build a robotic car using 12V DC motors, Arduino Diecimila microprosessor, L298N H-Bridge motordriver, 9V battery, wires and a meccano chassis.
